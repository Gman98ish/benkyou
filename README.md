# Benkyou

Benkyou is a Japanese language learning tool. Instead of translating a sentence directly, it breaks it down into
its components, explains them individually and within their context. This should encourage the user to make
their own translations, and learn the grammar patterns and phrases themselves.

It also provides links to the dictionary definition of a word. Even if it's conjugated, it'll look it up using the
dictionary form

At the moment, it only recognises a handful of the most common elements of Japanese, and the explanations are still
rough. But given enough time, this could be a really handy learning tool/reference.

If you notice a bad explanation, or a pattern that it doesn't recognise. Please raise an issue

If you're a proper Clojure dev and notice something weird I'm doing, please let us know. I'm quite new to Clojure
and accept that this isn't the nicest of codebases
